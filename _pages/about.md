I'm a PhD candidate in Computer Science at the University of Pittsburgh, working under the supervision of [Dr. Adriana Kovashka](https://people.cs.pitt.edu/~kovashka/index.htm). My research interests are Computer Vision, Multimodal Reasoning, and Generative AI. My current research is on:
* Generation and Evaluation of Persuasive Advertisement Images
  * Persuasiveness, Creativity, and alignment evaluation
  * Image generation for abstract text inputs
* Understanding Advertisement Images
  * Complex and Multi-step reasoning on images
  * Atypicality understanding of the images
