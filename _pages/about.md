I'm a 4th year PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Pittsburgh, working under the supervision of [Dr. Adriana Kovashka](https://people.cs.pitt.edu/~kovashka/index.htm). My research interests are Computer Vision, Multimodal Reasoning, and Generative AI. My current research is on:
* Generation and Evaluation of Persuasive Advertisement Images
  * Persuasiveness, Creativity, and aligment evaluation
  * Image generation for abstract text inputs
* Understanding Advertisement Images
  * Complex and Multi-step reasoning on images
  * Atypicality understanding in the images
