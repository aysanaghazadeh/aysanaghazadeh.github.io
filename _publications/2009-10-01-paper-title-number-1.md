* In this paper, we introduce three novel tasks to evaluate the VLMs' perfromance in complex reasoning on atypical images task.
* We introduce a new adversarial dataset on [PittAd](https://people.cs.pitt.edu/~kovashka/hussain_zhang_kovashka_ads_cvpr2017.pdf) to assess the VLMs' semantical understanding against LLMs.
* We show that although VLMs are able to generate acceptable and useful descriptions for LLMs to understand the images their performance is lower than LLMs in reasoning and semantical understanding of the images.
